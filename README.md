# plant-growth-segmentation
A Python-based image segmentation model for monitoring plant growth. This project uses OpenCV and NumPy for color-based segmentation, edge detection, and thresholding to isolate plant regions in images. It also includes growth analysis (leaf counting) and health detection based on color changes.
